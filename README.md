# Spotify
Get a CSV file of your most streamed artists and songs from your personal data
## Prerequisites
 - You need to download your streaming data from spotify
  	Go to spotify.com/us/account and enter your login credentials.
    In the menu on the left-hand side of the screen, click on Privacy settings.
    Scroll down to the Download your data section.
    Go to Step 1 > Request. ...
    You will receive an on-screen notification saying Spotify is processing your data.
      
 - Once you have the data you put the path of your StreamingHistory JSON files into my code one at a time (or combine the JSON files into one file which I reccomend)
 ## Running the code
  - if you run the code after putting the path of your JSON code in it will print out all your top artists and how many times you streamed them, in decreasing order, and then 
  creat a CSV file. it will do the same to your top songs and the number of times you streamed them. The CSV files should be "top_songs.csv" and "top_artists.csv"
